# Shorty Challenge

Requirements have been moved to [requirements.md](./REQUIREMENTS.md)

## Running instructions:

  1. You need to have Docker installed - [docker installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation)
  2. You need to have Docker Compose installed - [docker compose installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install)
  3. In the root directory of the project run `docker-compose -p impraise up`
  4. The service should be accessible on localhost:8080

## Running the tests

  1. Make sure you went through the previous step, and the container is running. Run `docker ps` in terminal. You should see a container named `impraise_shorty_1`
  2. Execute `docker exec -it impraise_shorty_1 go test -v -cover -timeout=5m -goblin.timeout=5m`
  3. ???
  4. Profit?

## Known issues / Reflections

  1. Running the tests on my machine, they finish in ~1 second. When running the tests inside the docker container, the running time spikes to ~3 minutes !?
     * I'm either doing something wrong (very likely)
     * Docker is a bad boy (less likely, but still a plausible cause)
  2. On Redirect, the API returns a 302 Found status code. However the `gorequest` library I have used to make the requests, seems to get a 200 OK :-(
  3. I'm pretty satisfied with the test coverage: 90%. Seems to have covered pretty much all the cases.
